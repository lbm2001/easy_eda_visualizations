## 1 Project Motivation
As I worked on some Data Science projects I noticed that there are activites that are performed in each project, especially
when it comes ot Exploratory Data Analysis. Therefore I wrote some functions to plot e.g. histograms, boxplots or kdeplots
for the columns of a dataframe to speed up the EDA process.

## 2 File descriptions
`easy_eda_visualizations_package` is the project directory\
`easy_eda_visualizations` is the actual Python package which contains:
- `eda.py`: The Python code of the package
- `__init__.py`
- `license.txt`
- `README.md`
- `setup.cfg`

`setup.py` is the setup file for uploading to PyPi.

## 3 Installation
All libraries used in this code should be in the standard Anaconda distribution of Python.
The Python version used writing the code was 3.9, therefore there should be no issues with running the code
using Python version 3.*.

The package can be installed using `pip install`.
